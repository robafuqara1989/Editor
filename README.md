#**what is text editor?**

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.

##**the difference between text editor and IDFS:**

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.

#**important concepts:**

*Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.

*Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.

*Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
